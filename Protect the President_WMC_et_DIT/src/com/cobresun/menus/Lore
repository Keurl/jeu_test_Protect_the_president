It was a beautiful day in Washington D.C. The sun was shining,
the tourists were taking pictures, and the Trump was tweeting.
All of a sudden, the White House recieved reports of an impeding
terrorist attack so Trump picks the closest moron to take care
of security, luckily it's you!

All the terrorists are dressed up as tourists so it'll be difficult
to tell whether or not they are up to no good.

You can set up snipers on buildings that will spot and kill 
terrorists in the crowd.

You can also put police officers on the streets to stop
everyone passing by. The will discover and stab any terrorists,
though they get tired after checking 20 people.

Finally, if all else fails you can click on them to kill them 
yourself! Sometimes the killers will equip their guns so keep
an eye out. But be warned: if you kill a tourist, it will
cause the White House to take damage.

Every time a killer gets into the house, the president will
take damage. Just keep him alive, no need to worry about a 
few scuffs on the skin.

Good Luck! I wouldn't want to be in your shoes.


Oooooo you got the president killed. Luckily, he was on
a golfing trip and just had a dummy in the oval office 
with a random word generator to tweet for him. He's still here 
for 3 more years, yay!

Good job man! The president got away with his life! ...
because he was actually out on a golfing trip. Maybe check
if he's in the office first before you go spending our 
defense budget, okay?
